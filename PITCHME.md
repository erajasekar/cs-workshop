## Problem : Check if a number is prime using Search

Let's say we have all prime numbers stored in a collection `primes`

```java

Array primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,97]

which can be looked up using : 

primes[0] = 2
primes[1] = 3
....
primes[i] = n

where 0 <= i <= 25

```
Now, Given any number N ( N < 100), tell if the number isPrime by search the array `primes`
