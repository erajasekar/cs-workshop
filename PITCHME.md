## What you need to know about Computers and Programming Job?

##### How to get started on programming?

---

## Introduction

This is Rajasekar Elango, Software Engineer at Salesforce.com

+++

@title[About Audience]

What are you curious to know about computer science?

Note: I encourage you to ask question whenever you have. Please don't hesitage.

## Are computers smart?
@title[Computers are stupid]

<p class="fragment">Computers are really **stupid**. But it is very *fast*. </p>
<p class="fragment">Humans are **smart**, but *slow*. </p>

+++
@title[Binary Introduction]

Infact, the processors inside the computer doesn't know anything other than 0’s and 1’s - refered as **binary**

+++
@title[Everything is stored as binary]

So all the videos, music and textual information you see in computers are stored as just 0’s and 1’s in hardware. 

---

## Why the digital world is based on binary.?
@title[Why digital world is binary?]

<p class="fragment">All the hardware is made from wonderful semiconductor material ***silicon***. It can easily change state between stop conducting ( **0** ) and start conducting ( **1** ) electricity through them. </p>
<p class="fragment">Silicon is used to make a tiny device called ***transistor*** which can store one bit of information ( 0 or 1). </p>

Note: Discuss about conductors and insulators.

---

## What's inside Computers?

> Computers are made of billions of tiny ***transistors*** which can be programmed to flip states between 0 and 1 using electrical signals.

+++

Just like billions of neurons fire in our Human brain based on visual, auditory or sensory signal.

## Why computers is a genius invention? 

- We invented a general purpose computer containing a array of transistors that can do many different things, depending on which transistors are swiched on and off. | 

- It could do anything from adding two numbers to flying an airplane. |

Note: It would be very expensive, if we had to build a new computer for every different thing we want to do.

## What is a Computers?

> Computer is a electronic machine that can be programmed to do zillions of different tasks.

<p class="fragment"> It could do something from adding two numbers to flying an airplane.</p>

@title[Essential components of the computers]

### A Computer has

#### Processor

Does the computational work.

The speed of the proccessor determines how fast computer can do the tasks.

+++

#### Memory

Stores all the information.

Memory capacity basically indicates you how many 0's and 1's it can store

+++

##### How many of you know what is GB or MB mean in iphone or computers?
@title[What does GB Mean?]

- Mega Bytes or Gigabytes is unit for measuring memory just like pounds for weight, ounces for liquid etc. | 

| 1 Bit          | Binary Digit 0 or 1 |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 8 Bytes        | 1 Byte              |
| 1024 Bytes     | 1 Kilobyte          |
| 1024 Kilobytes | 1 Megabyte          |
| 1024 Megabyte  | 1 Gigabyte          |

+++

#### Input interface

Like keyboard, touch screen, scanner etc

+++

#### Output interface

Like Monitor, Speaker, Printer

---

## How do you tell Computers to do something?

+++

We need to provide a sequence of instructions telling a computer to what to do which is called as ***Algorithms***.

+++

### How transistors execute Algorithms?

Transistors are combined to create ***logic gates*** that can perform logical operations like ***AND***, ***OR***, ***NOT***

Every algorithm, no matter how complex, can be reduced to just these three operations: AND, OR, and NOT.

+++

### Algorithm example

if a fever can be caused by influenza or malaria, and you should take Tylenol for a fever and a headache

+++

### Algorithms can solve complex problems

Algorithms can be combined together to solve complex problems.

Just like simple mathematical operations are combined to produce complex mathematical formulas.

+++
### Algorithms are everywhere

Algorithms fly the airplanes, forecast weather. They run factories, tell us driving directions and so on.

> Scientists make theories, and engineers make devices. Computer scientists make algorithms that connects both theories and devices.

---
## What is Programming?

@title[What is Programming?]

> Programming is the act of taking complicated human ideas and breaking them down into simple algorithms that computers can understand and follow.

A Programmer creates algorithms and codes them up in human friendly language like `Java` or `Python`

---
## What is Software?
@title[What is Software?]

Software is collection of programs that are written in language humans can understand and then they are converted into binary that computers can understand to execute them.

---

## Why Software is Eating the World?

* Six decades after the computer revolution

* Four decades since the invention of the microprocessor

* Two decades into the rise of the modern Internet
  ​
All of the technology required to transform every industry through software possible today.

+++

### Every Industry is revolutioned by Software

* Finance — Stock market, Paypal
* Retail — Amazon, online shopping
* Movies — Animation, Netfix
* Telecom — Skype
* Education — KhanAcademy, Udemy
* Healthcare 

Note: The best new movie production company in many decades, Pixar, was a software company. Disney — had to buy Pixar, a software company, to remain relevant in animated movies.

## Why being a Software developer is Great?

+++

### Drives creativity and innovation

* It's very creative profession as much like a musician or a painter.

* You create new things that doesn't exist before.

+++

### Make people's life better

You will solve problems to make people's life better.

+++

### Impact millions of people quickly

<img src="assets/image/50-million-angry-bird.png" alt="impact millions" width="500px" height="400px">

Telephone took 75 years, Internet took 4 years however Angry Birds took only 35 days!!

+++

### Colloborative 

Software engineering is a team sport and you work together to build amazing things.

+++

### Future proof

<img src="assets/image/STEM-Growth-Aggreg-2024.png" alt="Computing Demand" width="500px" height="400px">

As per US-BLS projections, computing will be the safest STEM career options for the foreseeable future.

+++

#### Pays well

* Because of high demand, Software developers are paid well.

* Software developers can create lot of value with no cost of raw materials.

* All you need is your time and a computer.

+++

#### Work from anywhere.

With the internet, you can literally work from any where in the world.
