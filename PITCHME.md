## Are computers smart?
@title[Computers are stupid]

<p class="fragment">Computers are really **stupid**. But it is very *fast*. </p>
<p class="fragment">Humans are **smart**, but *slow*. </p>

+++
@title[Binary Introduction]

Infact, the hardware inside the computer doesn't know anything other than 0’s and 1’s - refered as ***binary***

+++
@title[Everything is stored as binary]

So all the videos, music and textual information you see in computers are stored as just 0’s and 1’s in hardware. 

---

## Why the digital world is based on binary?
@title[Why digital world is binary?]

<p class="fragment">All the hardware is made from wonderful semiconductor material ***silicon***. </p>
<p class="fragment"> It can easily change state between stop conducting ( **0** ) and start conducting ( **1** ) electricity through them. </p>
<p class="fragment">Silicon is used to make a tiny device called ***transistor*** which stores one bit of 0 or 1. </p>

Note: Discuss about conductors and insulators.

---

## What's inside Computers?

> Computers are made of billions of tiny ***transistors*** which can be programmed to flip states between 0 and 1 using electrical signals.

+++

Just like billions of neurons fire in our Human brain based on visual, auditory or sensory signal.

## Why computers is a genius invention? 

- It will be super expensive, if we had to build a new computer for every different thing we want to do. 

- Instead, we invented a general purpose computer containing a assembly of transistors that can do many different things, depending on which transistors are swiched on and off.

## What is a Computer?

> `Computer is a electronic machine that can be programmed to do zillions of different tasks.`

<p class="fragment"> It could do anything from adding two numbers to flying an airplane.</p>

+++
@title[Essential components of the computers]

### A Computer has

#### Processor

* Does the computational work.

* The speed of the proccessor determines how fast computer can do the tasks.

+++

#### Memory

* Stores all the information.

* Memory capacity basically indicates you how many 0's and 1's it can store

+++

#### How many of you know what does GB or MB mean in phone or computers?
@title[What does GB Mean?]

<p class="fragment"> Mega Bytes or Gigabytes is unit for measuring memory just like pounds for weight, ounces for liquid etc. </p>

<table class="fragment"> 
	<tr>
		<td>1 Bit </td>
		<td>= Binary Digit 0 or 1 </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>8 Bytes </td>
		<td>= 1 Byte </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1024 Bytes </td>
		<td>= 1 Kilobyte (KB) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1024 Kilobytes</td>
		<td>= 1 Megabyte (MB) </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1024 Megabytes</td>
		<td>= 1 Gigabyte (GB) </td>
	</tr>
</table>

+++
#### Input interface

Like keyboard, touch screen, scanner etc

+++

#### Output interface

Like Monitor, Speaker, Printer, etc

## How do you tell Computers to do something?
@title[What are Algorithms?]
+++

We need to provide a sequence of instructions telling a computer to what to do which is called as ***Algorithms***.

+++

### How transistors execute Algorithms?

Transistors are combined to create ***logic gates*** that can perform logical operations like ***AND***, ***OR***, ***NOT***

Every algorithm, no matter how complex, can be reduced to just these three operations: AND, OR, and NOT.

+++

### Algorithm example

if a fever can be caused by influenza or malaria, and you should take Tylenol for a fever and a headache

<img src="assets/image/algorithm-logic.png" alt="impact millions" width="400px" height="300px">

+++

### Algorithms can solve complex problems

Algorithms can be combined together to solve complex problems.

Just like simple mathematical operations are combined to produce complex mathematical formulas.

+++
### Algorithms are everywhere

Algorithms fly the airplanes, forecast weather. They run factories, tell us driving directions and so on.

*Scientists make theories, and engineers make devices. Computer scientists make algorithms that connects both theories and devices.*

---
## What is Programming?

@title[What is Programming?]

> `Programming is the act of taking complicated human ideas and breaking them down into simple algorithms that computers can understand and follow.`

A Programmer creates algorithms and codes them up in human friendly language like `Java` or `Python`

---
## What is Software?
@title[What is Software?]

Software is collection of programs that are written in language humans can understand and then they are converted into binary that computers can understand to execute them.

Softwares run computers, smart phones, ATM machines, Billing machines.

---

## Why Software is Eating the World?

* Six decades after the computer revolution

* Four decades since the invention of the microprocessor

* Two decades into the rise of the modern Internet
  ​
* All of the technology required to transform every industry through software possible today.

+++

### Every Industry is revolutioned by Software

* Finance — Stock market, Paypal
* Retail — Amazon, online shopping
* Movies — Animation, Netfix
* Telecom — Skype
* Education — KhanAcademy, Udemy

Note: The best new movie production company in many decades, Pixar, was a software company. Disney — had to buy Pixar, a software company, to remain relevant in animated movies.

## What's fascinating about future of Computers?

What if we can teach Computers to learn by itself.

We are heading towards making machines to learn and creating artificial intelligent systems.

+++

### What is Machine learning?

Machine learning makes computers to learn skills that humans can't explain.
Machine learning works by analysing large data set of examples and figuring out Algorithm.
We can think of machine learning as inverse of programming just like Square root is inverse of Square.
With machine learning, computers write their own programs, so we don’t have to.

+++

### Machine learning makes computer learn human skills

* [AutoDraw](https://www.autodraw.com/) is a that pairs the magic of machine learning with drawings from talented artists to help everyone create anything visual, fast. 
* Computers can recognize our face, our voice, handwriting , etc.

+++

### Robots are becoming part of your lives

* iRobot vaccum can find it's way through your home to clean everywhere.
* Siri , Alexa, Google Assistant are able to answer our questions just like humans.

+++

### Computers beat human world champions.

* Deep Blue (Chess computer) beat World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.
* In 2015, AlphaGo beat Go world Ke Jie. 
* Go is very complex game compared to Chess, it won't be possible without machine learning.

+++

### How will future look like?

* Self driving cars will become common on the road.
* Every home will have some kind of a Bot.
* All devices in your house will be a smart device like smart phones.
* You will be helped by Chat Bots and Virtual assitants on the internet.
